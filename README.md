# Sample-Data-Projects
The folder contains several sample data projects

**Project name: Gym - Membership management and marketing**

**Usecase:** In a local gym, every month there is a need to find out the list of members who are currently active and
enrolled for the "Gold", "Silver" and "Bronze" memberships. This will help the gym's marketing team to plan for targeted
promotions of various services offered at the gym to selected group of members.

**Problem statement:** Currently, someone have to manually evaluate the "current members.txt" file to address the above usecase. It would be great,
if this process can be automated with python program

**Note:** for illustration purposes of this project, we are going to generate some sample data and then process it to address the usecase listed above.
    Input:
    "MonthlyFile" --> File that contains the list of all members (including active/inactive and all membership categories) at the end of each month.
    Output:
    "GoldMonthlyFile" --> File that contains the list of all members who have "Gold" membership
    "SilverMonthlyFile" --> File that contains the list of all members who have "Silver" membership
    "BronzeMonthlyFile" --> that contains the list of all members who have "Bronze" membership

**How to run this program:** please install a python IDE, download the "gym_MemberManagement.py" and the "data" folders to your local and then run the python code.
